# NLP-and-Deep-Learning-Project-Youth-Mental-Health-Narratives-Automated-Abstraction-Challenge
I developed and fine-tuned transformer-based NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa) for multi-label and multi-class classification, achieving 75% accuracy and ranking in the top 50% of a competition. Leveraged PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Pandas for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

 ### Introduction
Youth suicide remains one of the leading causes of death for individuals aged 5 to 24 in the United States. To address this critical issue, researchers and policymakers depend heavily on narrative datasets like the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), which compiles data from multiple sources, including law enforcement, coroner/medical examiner reports, toxicology analyses, and death certificates. These datasets play an essential role in understanding the circumstances surrounding youth suicides and shaping targeted interventions.

Problem Statement
Despite its value, the NVDRS suffers from labor-intensive and error-prone data abstraction processes. Currently, extracting meaningful insights and ensuring data quality relies on manual effort, which introduces inefficiencies and inconsistencies. This bottleneck limits the timeliness and accuracy of critical insights needed for preventative measures.

Importance of the Study
This challenge aims to leverage machine learning techniques to automate the abstraction of key variables from NVDRS narrative text. By automating this process, we can significantly streamline manual abstraction tasks, improve data quality control, and reduce human error. Such advancements could revolutionize how researchers and policymakers handle mental health data, enabling faster and more reliable analyses.

Impact on Communities and Population
The outcomes of this work have the potential to drive transformative change in youth mental health research. Automating data abstraction will enhance the reliability of suicide data tracking, providing policymakers with accurate and timely insights. This, in turn, will enable the development of more effective prevention strategies, ultimately helping communities combat youth suicide and protect the mental health of vulnerable populations.
